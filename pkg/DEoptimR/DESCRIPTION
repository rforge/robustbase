Description: Differential Evolution (DE) stochastic algorithms for global
  optimization of problems with and without constraints.
  The aim is to curate a collection of its state-of-the-art variants that
  (1) do not sacrifice simplicity of design,
  (2) are essentially tuning-free, and
  (3) can be efficiently implemented directly in the R language.
  Currently, it only provides an implementation of the 'jDE' algorithm by
  Brest et al. (2006) <https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133>.
