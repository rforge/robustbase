* Before next release
** TODO nlrob()
*** TODO summary(nlrob(*)) fails for new methods; better error message or *work*
*** TODO residuals( nlrob(), type = "...") should provide types "as in the literature"
*** DONE nlrob(*, method = "...") should call methods "tau", "CM", "MTL", "MM"
    by Eduardo Conceicao
**** DONE shouldn't we rename jde() to jdeopt() or even jdeoptim(), jDEoptim(), or JDEoptim()
R users already know optim() etc.. so the name seems more logical for them.

** TODO estimethod(): also for lmrob() and glmrob() models
* Short Term
** TODO nlrob(*):
*** TODO nlrob(*, method=.) -- try at least *one* other optimizer than JDEoptim(), 
 since we provide already most of the needed "hooks".
*** TODO nlrob(*, method="M"): try to allow a "fixed initial sigma" (--> inference for "MM")
** glmrob
*** BYlogreg()  [ R/BYlogreg.R ]
    --> more tests in ./tests/glmrob-1.R
    --> glm.fit() instead of glm()
    --> vcov() instead of just std.err. {is already there}
*** glmrob(*, weights.on.x = "robCov")  uses  MASS::cov.rob(),
   i.e. "MVE" and Andreas had a comment that "mcd" is worse.
   "covMcd" has been available for a while; now via robXweights() in ./R/glmrobMqle.R
   HOWEVER: Need something better when 'X' has (binary!) factors!
   "hat" +- works, but needs more work
*** We now allow  weights.on.x  to be an arbitrary general  wts(X, intercept)
   function _or_ a list containing a  robMcd()-like function.
   Definitely need *testing* this situation!
*** glmrob(<Gamma>):  anova() has  three variants: "V1", "Eva1", "Andreas1"
    --> ./R/glmrobMqle-DQD.R
    - gives warning every time {-> easy to fix}
    -  Default is "V1" is that a good idea?

*** glmrob() needs a bit more tests in ./tests/
            [also consider those from man/glmrob.Rd]
    take those from Martin's old 'robGLM1' package (need more!)
***  --> first test already shows that Martin's tests for "huberC == Inf"
       were *not* yet moved from robGLM1 to glmrob()...
    (in other words:  glmrob() should work

*** also, ni = 0 does not work quite as it should ( ./tests/binom-ni-small.R )

*** obj $ df ...  maybe should be defined -- for "glm" methods to be
   applicable  --> e.g. for predict(<glmrob>, interval="..") !

*** summary.glmrob() should be better documented;
   we should decide if the current return value is fine.

*** Eva's code (and MM's) also computed & returned the "asymptotic efficiency"!

*** anova.glmrob(): More modularization, allowing to provide own 'test' function.
   Test if Huber's C are different. Need theory to compare different C's and
   same model (which includes classical vs robust).

*** add1() and/or drop1() would be nice

** TODO scaleTau2():  Also do a cheap finite-sample correction [MM] !
   [DONE partly; but undocumented, since bound to change -->
   file:~/R/MM/STATISTICS/robust/1d-scale.R , 1d-scale-sim.R, etc --- unfinished!!

** TODO Psi/Rho/Chi/Wgt Functions
    We have quite a few "partial" collections of rho/psi functions; 
    some are "sync"ed now, some not yet::
*** TODO 1) have the nice S4 class psi_func  + psiFunc() and .defDwgt() functions
    in file:R/psi-rho-funs.R  with further explorations, ideas in 
    file:misc/experi-psi-rho-funs.R
**** TODO print/show of such psi_func should show more; at least the psi function
**** TODO str.psi_func() should be a bit nicer than the current default str()
**** TODO nlrob(): also allow psi to be a 'psiFunc':
       --> ./R/nlrob.R ; consider even more *real* checks; now in tests/nlrob-tst.R
*** DONE 2) deprecated: "old" tukeyChi() & tukeyPsi1()  originally called from lmrob() , in
       ./R/biweight-funs.R
*** DONE 3) psi.*(....,  rho = FALSE/TRUE)   functions from Andreas
       ([[file:.R/psi-funs-AR.R]]) replaced by using the new  psi_func  objects
**** DONE nlrob() changed: uses psi = .Mwgt.psi1("huber", cc=1.345) as default
*** TODO 4) have (C-based) functions Mpsi(), Mchi(), Mwgt(), etc, used from lmrob(), 
       in ./R/lmrob.MM.R
**** DONE now exported and documented in man/M.psi.Rd 
     Further files, illustrating features, differences, etc:
	 ./vignettes/psi_functions.Rnw -- with quite a few FIXME
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	 ./inst/xtraR/plot-psiFun.R	chkPsiDeriv() {and plot utils}
	 ./tests/psi-rho-etc.R   	compute asymp.efficiency and breakdown point !
	 ./tests/lmrob-psifns.R 	   	plot and lmrob()-test them

**** DONE Deprecate* the "2)", tukeyChi() etc, making them call the M.*fun():
**** TODO provide  '1)'-i.e. psi_func  versions of them
**** TODO Mpsi(*, "GGW") etc :  have no (??) easy way to directly specify (a,b,c) tuning pars
**** TODO *New* Mwgt(*,  deriv=1) would correspond to Dwgt in psiFunc() which Manuel needs
    
* Mid Term
** TODO New  lmrob() "M-S" etc features:
*** Function names with "." (which are exported) are frowned upon
      e.g.  lmrob.split()
*** checking .vcov.avar1() and its "posdefify" options ??
*** TODO lmrob.mar() [file:inst/doc/estimating.functions.R]: Maronna & Yohai (2010) should become part
         ~~~~~~~~~~  of robustbase, maybe under a better name,
    e.g. via lmrob( ... control ..) or directly.
    It is much used in the simulations of Koller & Stahel (2011)
*** TODO Provide "simple M" estimator [so MASS :: rlm() is entirely superseeded]
    Consider lmrob(*,  method = "M") --> default init = "ls" (Least Sq; as MASS:::rlm.default)
    which calls  lmrob..M..fit() which is already documented as "simple"
    M-estimator (though the *scale* is kept fixed; i.e., no  'proposal 2').
** covOGK():
   The argument name 'weight.fn' is pretty ugly and the default function
   name 'hard.rejection()' is just awful (we need a globally available
   function as 'role model'.
   - Could allow 'n.iter = 0' to simply compute Cov()_{ij} = rcov(X_i, X_j)
** rrcov etc
*** rrcov.control() __ NEEDS  name change ! ______
    probably use  mcd.control() and lts.control()

    or forget about *control() completely?
    since there are only a few in each ??????/

*** TODO tolellipse() --> renamed to tolEllipsePlot()
**** maybe use  cluster::ellipsoidPoints()
**** allow other percentiles than just  97.5%
**** maybe *return* something

*** plot(mcd. ) [ R/covPlot.R ] : should show the call
	      Default for 'ask' should be smarter: depend on
	      prod(par("mfrow")) < #{plots} (which depends on 'classic' and p=2)
*** ltsReg():  has  undocumented '$resid'
	      in addition to '$residuals' and '$raw.residuals';
	      drop it or document it !
** More lmrob() considerations
*** DONE more tests in	tests/

*** fully implement and test the multivariate case (y = matrix with > 1 col.)
*** src/lmrob.c :
     does median() , MAD() instead of using R's  sort() routines

* Long Term / Maybe
** inst/doc/lmrob_simulation.Rnw :
*** use hyperlinks {e.g. using jss docu.class!}
*** consider making parts available in (new) ./demo/lmrob...R
*** tau_i (p.5)  is not clear for  Joe Average.

..........................................

** Generalizing  'wgt.himedian':  We'd want a C API on which R builds.
    There are pure R implementations:
     - 'weighted.median()' in limma
    	  and I have generalized it ---> file:inst/xtraR/ex-funs.R
     - more general code (different 'tie' strategies; weighted *quantile*s)
       in file:/u/maechler/R/MM/STATISTICS/robust/weighted-median.R
     - The 'Hmisc' package has wtd.quantile()
** Miscellaneous
*** Alternative version of covOGK() for correlation-only
   using's Huber's correlation formula which ensures [-1,1] range
   --> ~/R/MM/Pkg-ex/robustbase/robcorgroesser1.R
   and ~/R/MM/STATISTICS/robust/pairwise-new.R

*** package 'riv' (author @ epfl.ch!) has 'slc()'  ~=  cov.S(.)  -- in pure R code
   doesn't Valentin have a version too?
   otherwise: test this, ask author for "donation" to robustbase

*** adjOutlyingness() :
     typo-bug is corrected; and I have made it more pretty.
     Still a bit problematic when denominator = 0
     Currently leave away all the c/0 = Inf and 0/0 = NaN values.

     MM: Maybe, it's the fact that the   coef = 1.5  should really depend on
         the sample size  n   and will be too large for small n (??)
   --> should ask Mia and maybe Guy Brys

*** Add data sets from the MMY-book -- mostly done {do we have *all* ?}

*** Data Sets --- Valentin Todorov has several of Rousseeuw's in the 'rrov' package
    (and promised me "the rest" when needed)
   Don't like the *.x, *.y  sub datasets: They shouldn't be needed when use a *formula*
   In his lts tests, he uses these "data sets from the literature":
   (Note that 'stackloss' is already in "datasets") :
    heart.x,heart.y,	   data(heart)
    stars.x,stars.y,	   data(stars)
    phosphor.x,phosphor.y, data(phosphor)
    stack.x,stack.loss,	   data(stackloss)
    coleman.x,coleman.y,   data(coleman)
    salinity.x,salinity.y, data(salinity)
    aircraft.x,aircraft.y, data(aircraft)
    delivery.x,delivery.y, data(delivery)
    wood.x,wood.y,	   data(wood)
    hbk.x,hbk.y,	   data(hbk)
