\description{
  The monthly use of steam (\code{Steam}) in a factory may be
  modeled and described as function of the
  operating days per month (\code{Operating.Days}) and
  mean outside temperature per month (\code{Temperature}).

\usage{data("steamUse", package="robustbase")}
\format{
  A data frame with 25 observations on the following 9 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Steam}:}{regression response \eqn{Y}, the poinds of
      steam used monthly.}
    \item{\code{fattyAcid}:}{pounds of Real Fatty Acid in storage per month.}
    \item{\code{glycerine}:}{pounds of crude glycerine made.}
    \item{\code{wind}:}{average wind velocity in miles per hour (a numeric vector).}
    \item{\code{days}:}{an integer vector with number of days of that
      month, i.e., in \eqn{28..31}.}
    \item{\code{op.days}:}{the number of operating days for the given
      month (integer).}
    \item{\code{freeze.d}:}{the number of days below
      32 degrees Fahrenheit (\eqn{= 0}\enc{Â°C}{'C} (C=Celsius) \eqn{=}
      freezing temperature of water).}
    \item{\code{temperature}:}{a numeric vector of average outside temperature in
      Fahrenheit (F).}
    \item{\code{startups}:}{the number of startups (of production in that month).}

  should be possible, see the examples.
