I have coded up the algorithm from the Cameron and Turner paper.  Dunno
if it gives exactly the same results as my (Splus?) code from lo these
many years ago (the code that is lost in the mists of time), but it
*seems* to work.

It is not designed to work with actual "streaming" data --- I don't know
how to do that.  It takes a complete data vector as input.  Someone who
knows about streaming data should be able to adapt it pretty easily.
Said he, the proverbial optimist.

The function code and a help file are attached.  These files have had
their names changed to end in ".txt" so that they will get through the
mailing list processor without being stripped.  With a bit of luck.

If they *don't* get through, anyone who is interested should contact me
and I will send them to you "privately".

cheers,

Rolf
