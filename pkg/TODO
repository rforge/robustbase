TO DO
------

o  Generalizing  'wgt.himedian':  We'd want a C API on which R builds.

   There are pure R implementations:
    - 'weighted.median()' in limma
    	 and I have generalized it ---> inst/ex-funs.R

    - more general code (different 'tie' strategies; weighted *quantile*s)
      in /u/maechler/R/MM/STATISTICS/robust/weighted-median.R


o covOGK(): is *inconsistent* (by a constant factor, depending on n)
  	    as long as it is used with the inconsistent scale.tau2()
	    {the one that was proposed in the paper}.
  The argument name 'weight.fn' is pretty ugly and the default function
  name 'hard.rejection()' is just awful (we need a globally available
  function as 'role model'.

  - Consider making 'hard rejection'  the default though!
  -   "        "    n.iter = 1 or = 2 the default.
