Note that  src/sn.f  and  src/qn.f  are still identically the same
as the 'sn' and 'qn' files one gets after downloading
sn.gz and qn.gz  from Antwerpen
e.g.,  http://www.agoras.ua.ac.be/Robustn.htm

NOTES:

1) we have had some problems, but they are solved now
     ---> tests/C-BUG-whimed.R

2) I think its wrong in principle to only work with *integer* weights
      for 'whimed'.
      Further note, that *because* of the integer weights, we need type
      'long long' {because otherwise integer overflow kills everything}.

   --> Change this `everywhere' and make  wgt.himedian() an R function

   NOTE: There is  'weighted.median()' in limma
   	 and I have generalized it ---> inst/ex-funs.R

3) Currently, I carry both the C and the original Fortran versions;
   I believe we now have proven they are equivalent;
   ===> SHOULD hence get rid of them.

>>   BUT: Do this by adding these to the new 'robustbase' package.
>>   {and make a "CRAN-repository" where 'robustbase' can be got from}
